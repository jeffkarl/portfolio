## Projects
#### Infor Ai/ML Birst Dashboards — Nov 2022 - 2024

Key stakeholder in the design, implementation, and integration of 3 Ai/ML projects developed through Infor. These projects forced us to utilize several Infor applications simultaneously, which gave us a better understanding of the capabilities and power of the modern Infor OS structure : Syteline to pull data from - Datalake to house the latest information - Quest Orchestration thru Coleman to crunch the numbers - Birst to present the data graphically to the end users as dashboards. Although the projects were not targeted well and may, in fact, not be utilized by those that were seeking these solutions, projects of this nature are very valuable for future, successful, implementations that provide answers to difficult to answer questions. These are cutting edge technologies just now being explored.

#### JDE ERP Implementation — Apr 2021 - Aug 2021

An ERP implementation change is very difficult for a company. Being the Infor Syteline ERP expert for our company, everyone placed a huge amount of this project on my plate. I spent several days in meetings explaining exactly how our business functions from sales to production to shipping to invoicing. Our implementation covered 2 locations in 3 countries. Without my thorough guidance during the implementation and my meticulous attention to detail with translating data from one system to another, the project would not have been as successful. Two warehouses were relabeled with new part numbers. Our processes had to be revamped for the new system because we were forced into someone else's system with already established processes. The dedicated people within our organization made it work and will continue to make it work while improving along the way. It was a lot of extra work that added a lot of extra steps without adding any personnel.

#### Business Process Mapping (BPM) Wiki — Dec 2018 - Apr 2019

Defined and mapped all of our business unit processes in a wiki through Atlassian Convercent platform. I was a direct contributor for a significant portion of the project, defining processes, and developing flow charts, where we finished a month early. Now, we use the wiki as our primarysource for training new employees. This has enhanced our ability to quickly find the information that we are looking for. We can access the information seamlessly through Microsoft Teams due to connecting links. Future goals of the project were to benefit across many business units by selecting or driving towards the best, most useful processes. I personally wrote hundreds of flow processes.

#### $10M Equipment Project — Mar 2016 - Aug 2016

A very large contract was awarded to our company for hazardous area equipment in which we had no design. Short staffed, I led the planning of the orders, made all the purchases without a buyer, negotiated huge discounts between 7-30% for excellent ROI, organized and maintained on time delivery with a very high degree of accuracy by working continuously on multiple fronts on the project. Much of the success of the project fell to me and my team. We fought through material shortages and issues, scheduling constraints, and design issues. The installation timeframe was drastically under planned from a sales perspective. I laid out a plan that would work and communicated towards very good execution on the part of my team. We shifted resources to achieve our milestones to be on time and well below budget making our internal and external customers very happy.

#### $25M Equipment Project — May 2013 - Dec 2013

During my time as a Project Manager for an OEM producing coiled tubing units, I was given a major, behind-schedule project that would have failed without my diligent involvement. Our deliverable was to ship 12 coiled tubing units with 6 fluid pumpers before the end of 2013. If the units had not arrived in St. Petersburg before that time, contractual penalties would begin to mount. Over the next several months, I organized resources, developed timelines, ordered materials, continuously reevaluated our requirements, pushed operations, engineering, and supply chain towards a successful result. It was an added-on project to the many projects that I was already responsible for. I did not expect the project to get done within that small amount of time, but we made it happen. It was completed with better-than-expected margins as well. I learned many things during this project. A key point was that I had to influence people that I was not in charge of. Keeping a positive attitude while continuously checking for feedback helped in that respect. Near the end of the timeline, I realized that we had less time than previously thought because of how long it would take to ship the equipment. Manifesting on ships to then offload for rail head travel to the destination was a big surprise. I adjusted the timelines and communicated what we were needing to accomplish. It was also interesting to have high level management meetings because of the priority of the project. The day-in day-out grind was challenging, but not overwhelming. It was fun to see the project finish as a success.

#### Operation Iraqi Freedom III — Jan 2005 - Dec 2005

Led a platoon of 45 infantrymen during Operation Iraqi Freedom III. Our mission revolved around theater security where we ran operations to keep the roads free of hazards related to transporting materials on the main supply routes. My team managed 3 locations. Because of their continuous vigilance, we were very successful in our mission. We improved the locations and working relations with the local people. We helped to fund and improve infrastructure, mainly around improving the roads and water supply. I set up and led several interactions with local leaders and project managed many improvements. My involvement helped pave the way for stability and peace within the areas that we operated. Location building improvements included adding Hesco barriers, upgrading tents to wood and metal structures, adding pressurized water for showers, adding noise reducing devices and materials around our 1.5 KVA generators, and others. The surrounding villages benefited from us adding culverts to strategic thoroughfares, removing structures and debris from overpasses on the main supply routes, destroying 10s of thousands of live ordinances, delivering equipment to improve roads and canal waterways, and other helpful support to the local people.
